## 📱 Usage

### User Flow

1. **Browse Products**: Go to `/products` to see available clothing items
2. **Check Size**: Click "Check My Size" on any product
3. **Upload Photo**: Upload a clear upper-body photo facing the camera
4. **Get Results**: View your measurements and fit recommendations

- Upload product images
- Delete existing products

## 🔌 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                                  | Description                          |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| GET    | `/`                                       | Health check                         |
| GET    | `/products`                               | Get all products                     |
| GET    | `/products/{id}`                          | Get single product                   |
| POST   | `/admin/add-product?key=MYSECRET`         | Add new product                      |
| DELETE | `/admin/delete-product/{id}?key=MYSECRET` | Delete product                       |
| POST   | `/measure`                                | Extract measurements from image      |
| POST   | `/compare`                                | Compare user vs product measurements |
| POST   | `/analyze?product_id={id}`                | Combined measure + compare           |

## 📊 Size Comparison Logic

The system compares user measurements with product measurements:

| Difference      | Status            |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| > +2 inches     | Loose             |
| -2 to +2 inches | Normal (Good Fit) |
| < -2 inches     | Tight             |

## 🤖 AI Measurement Extraction

The system uses MediaPipe Pose to detect body landmarks:

- **Shoulder Width**: Distance between left and right shoulder landmarks
- **Chest**: Estimated from shoulder width (multiplier-based)
- **Sleeve Length**: Shoulder → Elbow → Wrist distance
- **Torso Length**: Shoulder to hip distance
- **Neck**: Estimated from face width

**Scaling Reference**: Face width (~6 inches) is used to convert pixel measurements to inches.

      "description": "Good fit (+1.5 inches room)"
    },
    "overall": "Good Fit",
    "recommendation": "Recommended: Normal Fit"
  }
}
```

## 📸 Photo Guidelines

For best measurement accuracy:

- Use a clear, well-lit photo
- Face the camera directly
- Stand straight with arms slightly away from body
- Wear fitted clothing (not baggy)
- Include full upper body (head to hips)

## 🔮 Future Upgrades

This codebase is designed to be modular for future enhancements:

- [ ] User authentication system
- [ ] Cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary)
- [ ] Full VTON model integration (CP-VTON / TryOnDiffusion)
- [ ] Database migration (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
- [ ] Improved measurement accuracy with depth sensors
- [ ] Multiple size recommendations (S, M, L, XL)
- [ ] Mobile app version

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MediaPipe installation fails**

   ```bash
   pip install mediapipe --upgrade
   ```

2. **CORS errors**

   - Ensure backend is running on port 8000
   - Check that frontend is on port 3000 or 5173

3. **Image upload fails**

   - Check that `/uploads` directory exists
   - Verify file permissions

4. **No pose detected**
   - Use a clearer photo
   - Ensure good lighting
   - Face the camera directly
